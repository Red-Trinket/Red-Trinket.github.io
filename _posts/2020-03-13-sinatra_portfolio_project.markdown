The second portfolio project on the cirriculum is the Sinatra project - I was tasked with creating a simple Content Management System that would allow users to signup/create unique accounts, login, and then create and manage data in a variety of ways. From the beginning, this project did not have one challenge that the previous one did: the setup. Whereas the CLI gem project posed some difficulty in the early stages, this one was fairly straightforward to get set up correctly, perhaps just because I'm becoming more comfortable as I progress through Flatiron's program. 

That's not to say that there were never any bumps in the road. As I continued to work on this project, I came upon several different issues that tested my skill as a programmer and my ability to problem solve. The first one that I ran into was simply keeping all of my routes straight. It definitely is taking a lot of practice to get used to knowing where all of my forms are pointing and which routes handle which erb files. Eventually, I started to get the hang out it. If nothing else, this project has definitely been proven to be good practice for my future coding exploits. 

The biggest challenge that I ran into was making it so that the forms in my field required some sort of input. I tried testing to see if the input was empty with something like this:

Unfortunately, that didn't work. I spent a lot of the next few days on Google, poring over many a page on StackOverflow. Eventually, I found a solution that worked, which involved including HTML attributes in the tag itself so that the browser would know that an input was required. My final solution looked like this:

All in all, this was a very challenging experience, but a very rewarding one as well. I learned a lot about managing my paths, and also gained some new skills relevant to programming anything that includes HTML. The area where I feel like I grew the most is definitely just being able to manage my own code even when it starts to get rather complex.
